# NFT Nexus

This project is a frontend application developed for showcasing NFTs using React and TypeScript. The boilerplate used for this project is based on [react-vite-boilerplate](https://github.com/imohib168/react-vite-boilerplate).

## Architecture

The project follows a **Feature-based** architecture, where components and logic are organized based on features/modules within the application.

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Dashboard Design

The dashboard page has been designed according to the provided [Figma Design Artefact](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1169582885000138702). The color palette, fonts, and icons specified in the design have been incorporated.

### Task 2: NFT Display Logic

Implemented logic using the [Metaplex SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metaplex-foundation/js) to fetch NFTs owned by a specific owner. Displayed the first 3 NFTs dynamically as cards based on the fetched data, including image URI, mint address, and token address.
